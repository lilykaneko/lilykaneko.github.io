                <p>Hi, <br><br>My name is Lily Kaneko, and I grew up in Denver, Colorado. I recently graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech. I am looking forward to applying what I have learned from school and past internships to work on exciting new projects!</p>

                    <p><br>In the Portfolio section, I have posted many of my projects from college. However, many of my recent projects are under NDA, so they are only listed on my resume.<br><br>You can reach out to me by email at: <br>lily.r.kaneko@gmail.com<br><br>Thanks for taking a look at my portfolio!</p>
