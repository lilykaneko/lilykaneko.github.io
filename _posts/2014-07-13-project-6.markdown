description: Introduction to Engineering Visualization Project <br><br>For this project, I worked on a team of five to model a complex machine. The team decided to create a newly imagined Wall-E in Solidworks. Thus, the team decided to repurpose Wall-E into a robot that would be responsible for collecting samples on the moon.  I was responsible for creating the robotâ€™s arms. I had to ensure that the arms would retract and have enough allowance to be able to put items into the storage located in its body.<br><br>Below are pictures of the final result. The first picture shows all of the individual parts I designed for the arm assembly. <br><br><img src="img/portfolio/project6pic1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered">The second picture shows the parts I designed assembled into Wall-E's arm. <br><br><img src="img/portfolio/project6pic2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered">The final picture shows a rendering of everyone's parts in one assembly.<br><br><img src="img/portfolio/project6pic3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered">
