description: Mission to Mars Competition<br><br>For this project, I worked on a team of four to create a robot that would compete against other teams to complete five different tasks. To complete this task, I worked on prototyping a machine using SolidWorks as well as working to integrate mechatronics into the robot using LabVIEW. In addition, I worked on fabricating parts of the robot as well as conducting quality tests to ensure reliability and accuracy during the competition. The picture below shows a CAD model of the final robot that was created for competition<br><br><img src="img/portfolio/project5pic1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered">The video below explains the rules of the game, the design decisions, the CAD model, as well as the performance of the machine.<br><br><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DjSq9fJcB0T9Q5bqlI8wqk4v1CL7YLol/preview" width="300" height="200"></iframe>
