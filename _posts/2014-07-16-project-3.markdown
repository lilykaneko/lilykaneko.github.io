description: Robotic Musicianship<br><br>I worked in a research lab for Robotic Musicianship at Georgia Tech and contributed to two different projects within the lab. The first project was rapid prototyping an exoskeleton to aid in piano playing for stroke patients with hemiparesis. Since the goal was to allow the user to be able to play piano again, individual finger control was a key aspect in creating the designs. To start off the research, I read through many papers to get an understanding of the human hand and the effects of hemiparesis. I worked on multiple iterations of prototyping using 3D printing and CAD modeling to further the design from ideation. Below is an example of one of the early prototyped designs.<br><br><img src="img/portfolio/project3pic1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered">Since we were able to rapid prototype the different approaches for individual finger control, the team was able to experiment with which option was best. The final method chosen to control the motion of the patientâ€™s hand was string tension. The picture below shows the final prototype the team was able to achieve in one semester with the integration of mechatronics.<br><br><img src="img/portfolio/project3pic2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered">A separate prototype was created to test for feasibility for controlling the placement of the strings used to create tension, seen in the picture underneath. I was responsible for the attachment method of the tubing as well as troubleshooting issues that came with it.<br><br><img src="img/portfolio/project3pic3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered">The other project that I worked on, was creating a test fixture to determine typical loading forces in a hand. The data was needed to create specifications for the motors of a prosthetic arm with the same goal in aiding a person to play piano.
