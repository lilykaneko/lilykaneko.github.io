description: Pancake Drawing Robot <br><br>I worked with a team of four people to complete a robot in four weeks. The group chose to use an Epson six-axis robot as a starting base. The objective of the project was to have the Epson robot create pancakes in unique shapes. I was responsible for the design of the end effector to dispense the pancake batter as well as machining the part. In an effort to keep the design simple, I chose gravity as the main force affecting the dispensing of the pancake batter. The end effector was machined with a laser cutter. The pressure inside the bottle was manipulated to control the flow of the batter.<br><br>The robot was able to draw shapes using .svg files which were converted to coordinate points using MATLAB. I was in charge of creating the .svg files, using MATLAB to control the path of the robot, as well as figuring out the method to fill in the pancake with the batter.<br><br>The robot was also able to access a live video feed and take in the image to replicate the shape shown. This was done by writing a program that created boundaries around the given shape. After, the program would create coordinates based on the boundary for the robot to go to. I was also heavily involved in writing the program to create the boundaries. The video below shows the robot in action and further describes the steps taken in designing the robot.<br><br><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4gggkWlxzEVYN8ETRaKTFsXjpsyDW4g/preview" width="300" height="200"></iframe>
